        Runescape is a game that has existed since 2001, and is very nostalgic for millenials. <br>
        More specifically, it is an MMORPG that helped shape the genre, and goes strong into the modern day. <br>
        It's roots are in the early internet, created by Andrew Gower, founder of Runescape's parent company Jagex <br>
        Runescape exists in two distinct versions today, although there have been more, Oldschool, and Runescape 3.

        Why are there two different versions of an MMO you might be asking, well even if you aren't you're about to find out.
        Runescape had it's golden age for players and developers in 2007, but that's not what we're worried about.
        After establishing a strong community, the game went on to release controversial but acceptable updates until 2012.
        At this point, Jagex began implementing MTX, or microtransactions into Runescape 3, creating much community upheaval.
        Many players left the game during this period, but this was not the final straw for many players just yet.
        Following such controversial additions, Jagex decided to completely redesign the well liked combat mechanics of the game to be more like World of Warcraft.
        This led to mass uproar, with ingame riots and mass cancellations of subscriptions, leading to an eventual backpedal from Jagex.
        While Jagex didn't announce any plans to remove the update, they did run a poll to see if the community would appreciate an older version of the game being brought back online.
        This poll passed with flying colors, and nowadays Oldschool Runescape is the more popular game, currently boasting over 100,000 concurrent players at most times of day.
